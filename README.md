I have a plan in the future which is write APP home only instead of going to a company everyday! So, I look forward something from this course. I do not expect I will be a APP-PRO after this class. At least, I hope it will be good beginning, and I will learn the main structure of APP world.
Today, we setup all the software we need, android studio, samsung tablet driver etc. Also in android studio we need to set SDK choose 4.2.2 and so on. This made me feel so complicated, not like java we could just install an eclipse. However, It has some smart functions like auto import! I have not use android studio before, so I cannot tell which one is better compare to eclipse. We will see.
Last we ran 2 APP, one is fruit slick. It looks very good at the first look, but it is really hard to play, that funny guy walk around the fruit and just cannot pick it up! So it is not easy to make a good APP I guess. Then, we made a new project and I ran it. Suprisingly it showed me "hello world"! I get help with TA, he told me that is default and how to change it and add more things! Another thing which is really sucks is, we cannot use lastest version to make APP.
